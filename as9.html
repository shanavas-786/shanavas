<h2><a id="computer">COMPUTER</a></h2>
<a href="#top">Go to Top</a>
<p>A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations.Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed,the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.</p>
<h4><a id="cpu">CPU</a></h4>
<p>A central processing unit(CPU),also reffered to as a central processor unit,is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical,logical and input/output operations of the system.The term has been in use in the computer industry atleast since early 1960s.The form,design and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of the history,but their fundamental operation remains much the same.</p>
<h4><a id="alu">ALU</a></h4>
<p>In computing,an arithmetic and logic unit(ALU) is a digital circuit that performs integer arithmetic and logical operations.The ALU is a fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer,and even the simplest microprocessors contain one for purposes such as maintaining timers.The processor found inside modern CPUs and graphics processing units(GPUs) accomodate very powerful and very complex ALUs,a single component may contain a number of ALUs.</p>
<h2><a id="programming">PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</a></h2>
<a href="#top">Go to Top</a>
<p>A programming language is a formal language designed to communicate instructions with machine,particularly a computer.Programming languages can be used to create programs that control the behaviour of a machine and/or to express algorithms precisely.</p>
<h4><a id="c">C</a></h4>
<p>C is the one of the most widely used programming languages of all time,and C compilers are available for the majority of available computer architectures and operating systems.</p>
<h4><a id="c++">C++</a></h4>
<p>C++ (pronounced see plus plus) is a programming language that is general purpose,statically typed,free-form,multi-paradigm and compiled.It is regarded as an intermediate-level language,as it comprises both high-level and low-level language features.</p>
<h2><a id="dbms">DBMS</a></h2>

<h4><a id="rdbms">RDBMS</a></h4>
<p>A relational database is a digital database based on the relational model of data, as proposed by E. F. Codd in 1970.A software system used to maintain relational databases is a relational database management system (RDBMS). Virtually all relational database systems use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and maintaining the database.</p>
<h4><a id="oodbms">OODBMS</a></h4>
<p>An object database is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming. Object databases are different from relational databases which are table-oriented. Object-relational databases are a hybrid of both approaches.</p>
<h4><a id="hdbms">HDBMS</a></h4>
<p>A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data are organized into a tree-like structure. The data are stored as records which are connected to one another through links. A record is a collection of fields, with each field containing only one value. The type of a record defines which fields the record contains.</p>
